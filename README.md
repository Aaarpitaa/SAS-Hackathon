Won the Regional award, for sharing their innovative ideas and solutions to a real-world challenge (End Forced Labor)
In today's interconnected world, supply chain companies play a pivotal role in driving global commerce and ensuring the smooth flow of goods and services. As they expand their global footprints to meet the demands of consumers efficiently, a dark reality lurks beneath the surface. Forced labor, a form of modern-day slavery, continues to persist within the intricate web of global business supply chains. Today, more than 27 million people are in situation of forced labor worldwide on any given day. People are taken to a crowded factory, and forced to work 12 hours a day, 7 days a week where the factory is unsafe and are often subjected to verbal and physical abuses.
 
Now, one might ask, can we turn a blind eye to this injustice? The answer is a resounding no! As conscious global citizens, we are compelled to take action, seeking solutions and taking steps to eliminate potential labor exploitation and modern slavery within supply chains.
 
Nowadays, both businesses and customers are seeking partnerships with ethical counterparts. In fact, investors now scrutinize a company's ethical practices before making any investment decisions, and potential employees carefully evaluate a company's ethical record before considering joining them. Governments worldwide have also taken action by implementing legislation that mandates businesses to assess human rights risks in their supply chains and implement measures to address those risks.
 
Supply chains can be incredibly complex, involving multiple tiers of suppliers, sub-contractors, and intermediaries. This complexity often makes it difficult for companies to fully comprehend the working conditions and labor practices at each stage of the supply chain. Forced labor can be easily hidden within these convoluted networks, making detection and accountability a daunting task.

Moreover, the data on Forced labor is limited, and even if it exists, it is often from multiple sources, making it difficult to combine it into one view. So, we have taken up this research in association with the international charity organization- Hope for Justice and social enterprise Slave-Free Alliance, a data-driven approaches to help organizations move toward slave-free operations and supply chains, to create a model that can identify and highlights patterns to detect possible labor exploitation in difficult-to-track supply chains.
